   Subject: [Caml-list] parsing included files recursively using ocamllex and ocamlyacc


   
   I'm writing an interpreter for a small language (to be released as an 
   open source library), using ocamllex and ocamlyacc.  I'd like this 
   language to support an instruction that, at compile time, recursively 
   includes source code from another file.
   
I use the following approach:
- recognize the include directive in the lexer
- built an abstract lexer that wraps the original lexer and that
  + maintains a stack of lexers with some additional state
  + treats INCLUDE and EOF tokens
- the parser is called on this abstract lexer
This is all straightforward, the only subtle thing is that the
abstract lexer has to substitute the lexbuf argument coming from
the parser with the top of its internal lexer stack. Except for
the first call: In this case the lexbuf argument describes the
top-level input stream. You use this first lexbuf to initialize
the lexer stack.

The disadvantage of this approach is that you cannot have tokens
that span over several files.

In the following I give a few code samples.

The lexer contains the following rule:

     | "#include" [' ' '\t'] '"'
                                { let f = string lexbuf
                                  in 
                                    INCLUDE( f, get_loc lexbuf )
                                }

(get_loc is not relevant; it tracks line and character numbers.
 string matches everything until the next ``"'')

The grammar does not mention the INCLUDE token, instead the
parser is called as

  Grammar.file Abstract_lexer.token

The Abstract_lexer module contains the following:


    exception Include_error
(* to signal an error with the include directive *)


    let empty s = 
      try
        ignore(Stack.top s); false
      with
        | Stack.Empty -> true
(* Stack.empty, which was missing in earlier releases *)


    let d s =
      if debug_level _DEBUG_LEXER
      then begin
        prerr_endline s;
        flush stderr
      end

          closing_action : unit -> unit
        }

   line and character numbers. The closing action is for 
   close_in <include file. I prefer a closure here because the
   toplevel input might be a string.
